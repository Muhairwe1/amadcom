    <h1 id="myHeader">THE SCI-FI RAY THAT ZAPS PEOPLE INTO THINGS</h1>
    HULU, together with a random guy in somewhere out there called Paul, secretely developed a game based on the show's 9th episode of season 3.<br>
    The game looks at the episode's story from a slightly different angle. They wont be fighting to win some town contest, but instead, they will be<br>
    fighting just bullies and jerks.<br>

        It gets even better, they use their hovercraft to travel all over the world to as they locate the bullies. Along your journey, you will encounnter<br>
        some familiar faces from other universes that we all know, i guarantee you, you will be shocked. Strictly only bullies, i promise. <br>
        Oh, and guess what, if you think the game has only four characters becasue the show depicts four family members, you are in for a ride.<br>
        Be sure to hold your game pad for a very very long time.
